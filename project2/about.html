    <h2>Hello!</h2>
    <p>I am New Media Design student at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) graduating December 2019 with a passion for creative problem solving.
        I am also currently a graphic designer at RIT's Career Services and Co-op Education Office and designer/illustrator at RITâ€™s Reporter Online and Print magazine.
        I have a handful of other intern experiences including a continuing a full-time Summer position remotely part-time as a user experience intern with General Electric.

    <h2>I Love Technology</h2>
    <p>One of my main reasons for choosing to attend Rochester Institute of Technology was for my interest in technology and its well-known Engineering program.
        Two in a half years as an Industrial Engineering student and co-ops at Prolamina (Specialty Packaging & Print) and General Electric (Aviation) helped me discover my interest in programming.
        New Media Design became the perfect cross of creative design mixed with technology.
        I also love science and am a part of the House of General Science where I served as President of 2015-2016 winning E-board Member of the Year and 2015-2016 House of the Year.
    </p>

    <h2>I love Adventure</h2>
    <p>Adventure is an important part of my life. I have a passion for travel and making memories through unforgettable experiences. 
        I deeply enjoy slack-lining, gymnastics, camping, and exploring.
        Some of my favorite places that I have been to lucky enough to travel to include Costa Rica, Amsterdam, Puerto Rico, San Francisco and Hawaii. 
        In addition, I am Captain of Rochester Gymnastics and President of the RIT Gymnastics Club.
