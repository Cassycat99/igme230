    <h1>USER EXPERIENCE DESIGN</h1>
    <p>User experience design and healthcare are two very influential fields that make a great impact on every day interactions. This project is important to me because designing for impact is something that I have an interest in.</p>

    <h2>USERS</h2>
    <p>Primary: Medical Professionals
        <br>Example: Doctor, Nurse</p>

    <h2>USER STORIES</h2>
    <p>As a nurse, I want to be able to easily gather information from a patient so that I can support a smooth and efficient transition between medical professionals in my office.</p>
    <p>As a doctor, I want to enter an appointment with easy access to relevant information so that I can act most effectively and accurately to medical situations.</p>

    <h2>WIREFRAMES &amp; OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT</h2>
    <p>After exploration with wireframes, I was able to see additional areas for improvement in both the user interface (UI) and the user experience (UX). Some of the UI improvements included reevaluating the visual hierarchy of critical and non-essential information, the use of color to both direct and increase user engagement, additional titles to improve scannability, and text-alignment to ensure clear readability.</p>

    <p>In addition, the wireframes also made me ask, what about the secondary user? How could this a patient's experience be affected by this technology?</p>

    <h2>CONSIDERING A SECONDARY USER</h2>
    <p>While a medical professional would be the primary user of this technology, a patient would still be impacted by its interactions. How could the user experience of a patient be approved upon between wireframes and final production?</p>

    <p>As a patient, I want to have a personal connection with my medical staff so that I feel more comfortable and less anxious about a doctor's visit.</p>

    <h2>FINAL DESIGN</h2>
    <p>An important part of a nurse's day is to collect a record of information for both patients as well as their family history. By using a pre-populated and searchable library, a nurse is able to support consistency between medical professionals and their patients. In addition, the use of visual icons with hints of color help users to not only be more engaged with an user interface, but recognize data quicker too. When data is entered into the system, the user is also given success or fail feedback.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Pre-populated libraries can be very limiting to a user if their specific field is not available. To help with tension, but still support effective and useful taxonomy within the system, a "Add Custom" tile would become available after a user has searched for their desired content upload.</p>

    <p>Every patient is different so entering data should be a somewhat flexible interaction. This means that a nurse or doctor is able to not only choice the frequency of something such as a health choice, but the unit of said frequency as well. In addition, custom notes can be added within tiles. This allows key-details of medical situations to not be ignored while still upholding a standard structure of information.</p>

    <img class="Final" src="../images/final3.jpg" alt="Medical UI Final 3">
    <img class="Final" src="../images/final4.jpg" alt="Medical UI Final 4">
    </div>

    <p>Other important interactions within the system include supporting a doctor and patient interaction. After considering a patient as a secondary user, I decided to redesign the left navigation bar from the wireframes. The consistent personal summary across all screens now promotes a more personal interaction along with the addition of the patient's name on other screens.</p>

    <p>Finally, a scannable summary highlighting high risk conditions and health choices for both the patient and patient's family members can give doctor's a efficient way to pick out the most important information needed for their current situation. A hover state is used to bring up custom notes taken by someone else or a user can opt to use the left navigation to intuitively transition between additional details that they are searching for without feeling overwhelmed by too much information at once.</p>
