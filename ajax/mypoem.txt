<p id="verse1">She knows<br>
Of those<br>
Who do not care<br>
For paws<br>
And claws<br>
And feline hair.</p>

<p id="verse2">For kicks<br>
She licks<br>
The very one<br>
Who tries<br>
To rise<br>
And deftly shun<br>
The purr<br>
The fur<br>
The whiskered face<br>
Of that<br>
Darn car</p>

<p id="verse3">Who seeks a place<br>
To nap:<br>
She likes the best<br>
Is there--<br>
Right square<br>
Upon the guest<br>
Who blows<br>
His nose<br>
And starts to sneeze...<br>
The one<br>
Undone<br>
By allergies!
